# Home Assistant notifications on a SaF LED passenger information display
This is a small REST server that works in conjunction with the RESTful notification integration of Home Assistant.
It displays received notifications on a SaF LED passenger information display.
It also provides a switch entity that "turns off" the display by sending a blank message if needed.
Furthermore, it shows some sensor states by default that you will most likely need to customize.
